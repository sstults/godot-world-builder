### Goals
- [x] Create project structure

- Input map definitions need to be in project.godot for proper recognition
- Directory structure should follow Godot conventions for asset loading

### Next Steps
1. Create GitHub repository
2. Implement basic scene with moving geometry
3. Set up automated testing workflow
4. Document development patterns discovered
