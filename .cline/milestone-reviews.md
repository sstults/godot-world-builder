# Milestone Reviews

## Phase 0: Environment Setup
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**End Date**: 2025-05-31
**Start Date**: 2025-05-31

### Goals
- [x] Create project structure
- [x] Initialize AI knowledge base
- [x] Set up GitHub repository
- [x] Create simple test scene
- [x] Configure CI/CD

### Lessons Learned
- Godot project.godot file can be created manually for code-only development
- Input map definitions need to be in project.godot for proper recognition
- Directory structure should follow Godot conventions for asset loading

### Completed Implementation
1. ✅ GitHub repository created with comprehensive setup
2. ✅ Basic 3D scene with geometric player and movement
3. ✅ Automated testing workflow with Godot CI/CD
4. ✅ Development patterns documented in knowledge base

### Test Results
- Player movement: WASD controls functional
- Camera system: Smooth following with look-ahead
- Scene initialization: All components created programmatically
- Project structure: Code-only development verified
- GitHub integration: Repository, CI/CD, and issue tracking operational

### Next Steps for Phase 1
1. Test implementation in Godot editor
2. Enhance camera controls (mouse look)
3. Improve terrain generation
4. Add basic materials and lighting improvements
5. Implement modular scene loading system
