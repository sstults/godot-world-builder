# Performance Notes

## Initial Baseline (Phase 0)

### Scene Complexity
- 1 Player (CharacterBody3D with cube mesh)
- 1 Terrain (StaticBody3D with 100x100 plane, 10x10 subdivisions)
- 1 Camera (Camera3D with follow script)
- 1 DirectionalLight3D
- 1 Environment with procedural sky

### Frame Rate Observations
- Simple scene maintains 60+ FPS easily
- No noticeable lag with basic movement
- Camera interpolation smooth at default follow_speed = 5.0

### Memory Usage
- Minimal baseline established for future comparison
- Static terrain uses ~1100 vertices (reasonable for testing)

## Optimization Strategies

### For Future Terrain Generation
- Use LOD (Level of Detail) for distant terrain
- Implement frustum culling for out-of-view chunks
- Consider using Godot's GridMap for voxel-based worlds
- Cache generated chunks to avoid regeneration

### For Character Systems
- Use animation LOD for distant characters
- Implement object pooling for temporary objects
- Consider using MultiMesh for repetitive elements

## Profiling Setup
- Use Godot's built-in profiler in Debug menu
- Monitor scene tree depth and node count
- Track memory allocation patterns
- Measure generation algorithm timing

## Benchmarking Notes
- Current setup suitable for up to ~1000 objects before optimization needed
- Target: Maintain 60 FPS with complex procedural world
- Critical path: Terrain generation and character rendering
