# Procedural Generation Notes

## Wave Function Collapse (WFC) Implementation

### Core Concepts
- Constraint propagation algorithm
- Works with tile/pattern sets
- Ensures local consistency through global rules
- Deterministic given same seed and rules

### Implementation Strategy
1. Define tile types and adjacency rules
2. Initialize grid with all possibilities
3. Collapse lowest entropy cells first
4. Propagate constraints to neighbors
5. Repeat until fully collapsed or contradiction

### Performance Considerations
- Cache adjacency rules for fast lookup
- Use sparse representations for large worlds
- Consider chunked generation for infinite worlds
- Profile entropy calculation optimization

### Integration with Godot
- Use GridMap for voxel-style placement
- Custom Resource classes for tile definitions
- Separate generation thread for large areas
- Save/load generated chunks as .tres files

## Terrain Generation
- Start with simple height-based rules
- Add biome transitions using temperature/moisture maps
- Consider geological layers for mining systems
