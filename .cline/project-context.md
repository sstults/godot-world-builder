# Project Context for AI Assistant

## Project Overview
**Name**: World Builder 3D  
**Type**: Godot 4.x game development  
**Philosophy**: Code-only development with AI assistance  
**Current Phase**: Phase 2 - Core Systems Development  

## Current Status
- âœ… Phase 0: Environment Setup (Complete)
- âœ… Phase 1: Core Systems Development (Complete)
- ðŸŸ¡ Phase 2: Crafting & Interaction Systems (In Progress)

## Key Project Files & Purpose
- `/scripts/`: Core game logic (main.gd, player.gd, camera_controller.gd, etc.)
- `/scenes/`: Godot scene files (main.tscn)
- `/.cline/`: AI knowledge base (patterns, learnings, troubleshooting)
- `/.github/`: Issue templates and CI/CD workflows

## Development Workflow
1. **Start Here**: Always read this file first
2. **Check Issues**: Review current GitHub issues for active tasks
3. **Consult Knowledge Base**: Reference `.cline/*.md` files for patterns
4. **Implement**: Follow code-only development principles
5. **Document**: Update knowledge base with learnings
6. **Test**: Verify in Godot editor

## Current Architecture
- **Player System**: 3D character with movement, jump, run mechanics
- **Camera System**: 3rd person with mouse look and smooth following
- **Terrain System**: Procedural generation using noise-based heightmaps
- **Scene Management**: Async loading system for modular scenes
- **Lighting**: Enhanced environmental lighting with shadows and fog

## Next Priority Tasks
1. Basic crafting system foundation
2. Object interaction system
3. Inventory management
4. Basic UI system
5. Audio management

## Communication Guidelines
- Reference specific `.cline/*.md` files for detailed patterns
- Use GitHub issue templates for new tasks
- Always update knowledge base after implementations
- Follow established GDScript patterns from `development-patterns.md`
- Check `troubleshooting.md` for known issues
